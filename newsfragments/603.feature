``xia2.multiplex``: Add ``absorption_level=`` parameter to set the corresponding parameter in dials.scale. In addition, in ``xia2.multiplex``, if unspecified, decisions about absorption correction will be deferred to ``dials.scale``. This means that for large sweeps (>60Â°), absorption correction will now be turned on automatically.
